"# Project-Javascript" 
Calorie tracker by Andrew Qian

usage: Open index.html with a browser. Enter information about yourself then it will give you an estimate of how much calories you should have a day, plus it also allows you to keep track of how many calories you have already consumed.

Code Info:
Uses the materlize framework

Uses the module pattern as it's a small project project
and I didn't see the need for multiple classes.
